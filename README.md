# Aura-OnlineHijabStore
The Aura Hijab Store project is an online shopping system designed to facilitate the purchase of 
hijabs. Customers can browse products, place orders, make payments, and track deliveries 
through the platform. The system allows administrators to manage product listings, update 
prices, process orders, and track payments in real time. It also provides delivery personnel 
with order details and enables them to update delivery statuses. The project aims to 
streamline the shopping experience for customers and simplify store management for 
admins.
